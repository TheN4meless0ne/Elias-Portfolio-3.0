# My Programming Languages
My most proficient programming languages are Python and HTML, however, I have worked on projects using Java, GDScript and Lua as well.

Furthermore, I have worked a lot with Docker and Jinja, and am currently exploring frameworks such as React, NextJS and Tailwind CSS.

## Web Applications
#### Portfolio
I have made a few different styled portfolios. The first one I made was programmed with a Flask backend and HTML frontend, as part of a school assignment. After that I made a portfolio using React and Vite but ended abandoning it for a third iteration. That is the version which is currently used.

#### Gambling Bourghirs
I made wrote the backend code for a school group project called *Gambling Bourghirs*. This was written in Python, using Flask and Jinja to communicate with the site's frontend.

#### NoPaywallinator
NoPaywallinator is a browser extension I made using JavaScript which automatically removes the blur effect and subscription popup from select web based news sites. Note: This program does not grant access to content locked behind subscriptions but rather removes the inconvenience of the free content being blocked by the subscription popup.
